This attempt to amend the previous Constitution was not approved by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. However, this gave way for the following President, Rafael Correa, to establish a new constitutional framework. A Constituent Assembly was established in 2007; it drafted the current Constitution and got internal approval of it by July 2008. In September 2008, the draft constitution was approved in national referendum by a majority of 63.93%. A key feature in this Constitution’s text is its recognition of the value of nature, the Pacha Mama (Mother Earth), because we are part of nature and it is vital to our existence. The Constitution’s article 414 establishes that the State shall take a series of measures to tackle climate change, including protecting the population at risk. The article textually establishes the following: “The State shall adopt adequate and cross-cutting measures for the mitigation of climate change, by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and air pollution; it shall take measures for the conservation of the forests and vegetation; and it shall protect the population at risk”."

This Act requires electric service providers to make a net metering program available to customers by which customers may establish a renewable energy-powered customer generation system to produce electricity for their own use and to supply excess electricity to the electric service provider. The Act requires the electric service provider to offset charges for electricity by the amount of electricity supplied by the customer from the customer generation system and requires the electric service provider to give the customer credit for electricity generated by the customer that exceeds the amount supplied by the electric service provider. It requires the customer to meet certain safety requirements with respect to the customer generating system. It prohibits the electric service provider from imposing additional charges or fees to customers participating in a net metering program.

Through net metering, Palau hopes to 1) encourage investment in renewable energy resources, 2) stimulate economic growth, 3) reduce demand for electricity when alternative energy is available, 4) enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources used in Palau, 5) reduce fossil fuel imports for electricity generation and increase energy independence, and 6) reduce carbon emissions.

- Administration<br />
- Environmental impact assessments<br />
- Biodiversity<br />
- Bio-prospecting laws and community conservation areas (CCAs)<br />
<br />
The Amendment Act makes a number of important changes directly relevant to climate change.It includes a definition of climate change ('a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods', page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.<br />
<br />
The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu's obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.<br />
<br />
It establishes an Environmental Trust Fund, funded by penalties and bonds, which is to fund research, environmental rehabilitation, monitoring and analysis, management of community conservation areas, and as required for the protection and conservation of the environment.It also makes several amendments to enforcement provisions, environmental impact assessment procedures, bio-prospecting processes, and details of what constitutes an offence (and the associated punishments) under the 2002 Act."

It enables a proprietor of a lease (as registered under the Land Leases Act) to grant a forestry right over the land covered by the lease.<br />
<br />
The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as ‘a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land'. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.<br />

The Act was amended in 2012 (the Forestry Rights Registration and Timber Harvest Guarantee (Amendment) Act No. 8 of 2012) to include reference to sandalwood products."

This Constitution was passed in the light of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. Under the current constitutional text, environmental protection follows a set of principles, e.g. saving energy, and people have the obligation to co-operate to ensure a list of environmental protection actions (articles 255 and 256). The climate provision of this Constitution, specifically, is found in article 257, titled “Utilisation of natural resources and management of the environment”. On this regard, the Constitution sets an obligation for the State to establish mechanisms that address climate change in a very straightforward text: “The State shall, in the utilisation of natural resources and management of the environment […] g. establish and implement mechanisms that address climate change”."

<br />
The Environmental Management Agency formulates quality standards on air including GHGs. The Agency assists the management of environment by developing a national plan, regulating and monitoring discharge or emission of greenhouse gases and carrying out many other environment-related duties and functions as directed by the Minister. Environmental Management Board consists of nine to 15 members appointed by the Minister after consultation with the President. There should be at least one expert in each of the following areas: environmental planning and management; environmental economics; ecology; pollution; waste management; soil science; hazardous substances; water; and sanitation. One shall be a legal practitioner registered in terms of the Legal Practitioners Act, and another shall be the secretary for the Ministry responsible for the environment.<br />
