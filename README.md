# TopicModelingClimateLegislation
This is working with lower-to middle incomes economies and the legislation they have passed in the last 30 years. The dataset is gathered from the gratham climate law database. 


The data used is files that I could transform easily from pdf to text so there is limitations, as this is rather simplistic in code, and webscraping. 

The goal of the study is to understand the main strategies of climate legislation in non-OECD countries, and those as lower to middle-income status. 

The Analysis primarily uses the packages STM and Quanteda in R.
